**`roverctl` is a small terminal user interface (TUI) that provides you with everything you need to develop and work with ASE rover services and pipelines. Interaction is based on an active `roverd` instance, which comes preinstalled on your rover.**

## Installation

### Prebuilt
We provide Linux and macOS users with prebuilt binaries for both amd64 and arm64 systems. You can find and download the latest releases [here](https://github.com/VU-ASE/roverctl/releases/latest). To make installation even easier, you can run our install script, which will detect your system and add the binary to your path automatically:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VU-ASE/roverctl/main/install.sh | bash
```

### From source

To install the repository from source, you can use our Makefile:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VU-ASE/roverctl.git
cd roverctl
make build
./bin/roverctl
```
