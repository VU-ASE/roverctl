# Overview

**`roverctl` is a small terminal user interface (TUI) that provides you with everything you need to develop and work with ASE Rover services and pipelines. Interaction is based on an active `roverd` instance, which comes preinstalled on your Rover.**

## Features

With `roverctl` you can:

- Initialize a new service in any supported language
- Synchronize your service development with your Rover while you work
- Build and validate pipelines composed out of one or multiple services
- Manage pipeline execution and view logs and details
- View information about your Rover
- Manage multiple Rovers

`roverctl` runs on your own system and interacts with the public `roverd` REST API. You can find its source code [here](https://github.com/VU-ASE/roverctl).
